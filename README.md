# Hello, I'm ByteGuardian! 👋

## About me

I'm a **Junior Full Stack Developer** trying to create code that doesn't break too much. I promise sometimes it works. 🤷‍♂️

## My Superpowers 💪

- **DevOps Newbie**: As a DevOps administrator, I do my best to keep servers from blowing up. The servers are fine but my computer often feels like a toaster. **it is always in use.**

- **Adventurous E2E Tester**: I test everything from the user interface to the database. If something breaks, I blame the gremlins in the code.


### Education 📚

I am studying three engineering degrees at the same time. Yes, I'm a little crazy:

- [Electronic Engineering](https://estudios.unad.edu.co/ingenieria-electronica/) at the Universidad Nacional Abierta Y A Distancia (UNAD)
- [Artificial Intelligence](https://learn.microsoft.com/es-es/training/career-paths/ai-engineer) Engineering at Microsoft Learning
- [Security Engineering](https://learn.microsoft.com/es-es/training/career-paths/security-engineer) at Microsoft Learning


## Collaboration on Projects 🚀

I'm looking to collaborate on real open source projects that don't make me feel like an imposter. If you have one, let's talk!


## Fun Fact ⚡

⚡ I am a **microelectronics** specialist who also knows how to fix the coffee maker when it breaks down. If you want to contribute to my hardware lab, you can do so through my Patreon profile!
